#Notes and Usage

This script assumes you have run downloadsS3.py to get a local set of photos for photomaksing from a MicroPasts Amazon S3 bucket.
It is meant to loop through the downloaded images and correpsonding json files of task runs for that image on the MicroPasts site
and create binary jpg mask files in the same local folder as the downloaded images. 

NB. CURRENTLY WAITING ON FIXING A GLITCH WITH THE DATABASE BEFORE FINALISING THIS. DOES NOT CURRENTLY RUN.
