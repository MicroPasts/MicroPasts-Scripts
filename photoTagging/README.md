# Notes and Usage

These are scripts for manipulating the crowdsourced photo-tagging data from UCL's Horsfield archive.

phototagging_cleanup.R -- A set of example R commands that are currently run locally on an example set of photo-tagging outputs, so paths need to be changed. Also, this script will only work if you have admin access to contributor's full names (not publicly downloadable). 

The workflow re-arranges the JSON outputs from photo-tagging into a csv file that is more convenient to go through and consolidate.
