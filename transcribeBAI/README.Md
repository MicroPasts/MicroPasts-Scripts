#Notes and Usage

These are scripts for manipulating the crowdsourced transcription data from the British Museum Bronze Age Index.

transcribe_cleanup.R -- A set of example R commands that are currently run locally on an example set of transcriptions, so paths need to be changed. Also, this script will only work if you have admin access to contributor's full names (not publicly downloadable). The workflow re-arranges the JSON outputs from transcription into a csv file that is more convenient to go through and consolidate. It also does some rudimanetary clean-up via regex.
